# TO-DO list application
Let’s get started by creating a simple command-line to-do list application in Python. I’ll guide you through the process step by step. Feel free to adapt and enhance it as you see fit!
Here’s what the code does:
1.We define a Task class to represent individual tasks.
2.The ToDoList class manages a list of tasks.
3.Users can add tasks, view existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.
4.The application runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
# calculator 
Let’s create a simple calculator in Python that can handle basic arithmetic operations. We’ll prompt the user for two numbers and their desired operation. Here’s the code:
Here’s what the code does:
We define four functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) to perform the respective operations.
The main function:
1.Displays the available operations.
2.Takes user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
3.Calls the appropriate function based on the user’s choice.
4.Handles division by zero.
5.Prints the result.
# password generator
Creating a password generator is a practical project, and it’s great that you’re interested in building one. Let’s dive right in and create a Python script that generates strong and random passwords based on user specifications.
Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:
User Input:
> We’ll prompt the user to specify the desired password length.
> Optionally, we can ask if they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Generating the Password:
> We’ll use Python’s random module to create a random password.
> The password will be a combination of characters (letters, digits, and special symbols) randomly selected from the allowed character sets.
Displaying the Password:
> We’ll print the generated password on the screen.
